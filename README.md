This is a fork of Invoke-Parallel that has been tweaked to avoid hangs caused by timed out thread that cannot be closed by adding a -noCloseOnTimeout switch. This will cause a memory leak within the host process if any threads time out because the threads will not be disposed and the runspace will not be closed. The memory will be freed when the PowerShell host exits. If you have a script that must run continuously you could work around this by wrapping your Invoke-Parallel calls within a PSJob or otherwise running them in a separate process.
